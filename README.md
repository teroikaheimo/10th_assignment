Mobile Programming Assignment #10 BroadcastReceiver, IntentService, Room Database, LiveData

Make an application which listens to whether the screen is turned on/off with a BroadcastReceiver.

The exact time for opening and closing the screen is recorded in the application database in an separate IntentService, 
not in BroadcastReceiver.

The application has only a single screen which shows in a list all the timestamps when user had opened 
or closed the device screen.
